                The Borneo Cultures Museum has its origins in the Sarawak Museum, which was founded in 1891 by Charles Brooke, the Second Rajah of Sarawak. The original Sarawak Museum building was erected in 1889 in the Queen Anne style of architecture to house the diverse collections from the region.

            <p style="margin: 50px; color: #18392b; font-family: georgia;font-size: 180%; text-align: left; margin-left: 8%;">
            In the 1860s, Charles Brooke set up a temporary museum at the Marketplace along Gambier Street in Kuching. The actual Sarawak Museum building was built in 1889 and opened to the public on August 4, 1891. It was designed to permanently house and display local native arts and crafts and collections of local animals.

            <p style="margin: 50px; color: #18392b; font-family: georgia;font-size: 180%; text-align: left; margin-left: 8%;">
            The museum was extended to its present form in 1911. It formerly housed an exceptional ethnographic collection but was closed in 2017 for an RM308 million refurbishment project. As part of this, the new Borneo Cultures Museum was built across the street from the old Sarawak Museum building.

            The museum aims to become a lively place for social and cultural exchange, hosting a range of events and programs in its auditorium and function rooms. It features distinctive architecture inspired by Sarawak's traditional crafts and culture
