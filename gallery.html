            <p style="margin: 50px; color: #18392b; font-family: georgia;font-size: 180%; text-align: left; margin-left: 8%;">Level 1 Features an Exhibition on Shamanism in Borneo. The first gallery features shamanism in Borneo. It's quite dark and eerie. One of the first displays you'll see upon entering the gallery is a big screen tv that shows shamanism rituals.<br>I spent about 10 minutes watching the video. There are many shamanism tools displayed in the gallery, big and small. I must say that this is one of the most unique galleries in the museum.</p>

         <p style="margin: 50px; color: #18392b; font-family: georgia;font-size: 180%; text-align: left; margin-left: 8%;">Level 2 Features the Children's Gallery and the Arts and Crafts Gallery. The second floor's gallery is the Children's Gallery and the Arts and Crafts Gallery. It features a 'Love Our Rivers' theme, which focuses on water conservation. Also, there are playgrounds and a lounge for both kids and adults to enjoy.<br> There are many cute displays in this gallery, like the River Waste Band, which is a display of musical instruments assembled using wastes thrown into rivers. While the gallery is an interesting one, I didn't stay very long as it was very crowded and noisy at the time.</p>

         <p style="margin: 50px; color: #18392b; font-family: georgia;font-size: 180%; text-align: left; margin-left: 8%;">Level 3 Features the 'In Harmony With Nature' Exhibition. On the third floor, you'll find the 'In Harmony With Nature' exhibition. This gallery is the biggest one in the museum, covering 2,188 square metres. Visitors can learn about how the Borneo people co-exist with nature.<br>

         It displays traditional costumes (even those for shamanism rituals), old vases, fishing equipment, headhunting essentials, wood carvings, replicas of the different animals found in Borneo, the Bidayuh traditional house or 'baruk', and more. There are also interactive theatre panels that retell the folklore of the 'Santubong Princess'. I must say this gallery is one of my favourites.</p>

As discussed earlier, Borneo Cultures Museum is home to the calvaria of the 'Niah Lady'. You can find it among other interesting artefacts from the early civilization era on this floor. As you explore the gallery on level 4, you'll come across different sections, such as Cave Discoveries, Borneo and Empires, the Making of Sarawak, and Sarawak in Motion.<br>

            You can find bone ornaments, earthenware, the Sarawak map, old guns, and more. I came across a display of the old Sarawak flags, including the old Sarawak passport.</p>

On the last floor, you'll find the final gallery that features an exhibition called 'Object of Desire'. This gallery houses many artefacts that are believed to hold supernatural powers. There are wood carvings, scary wooden masks, beautiful handmade baskets and body accessories, gongs, wedding attires, and more.</p>
